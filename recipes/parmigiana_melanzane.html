    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds large eggplants, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons coarse salt, or as needed</li>
            
        <li>5 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            
        <li>2 tablespoons flour for dredging</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a single layer of eggplant slices in a colander sitting on a plate and sprinkle with coarse salt. Cover with a second layer and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant. Place a plate on top and add a weight to put pressure on the eggplant slices. Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Rinse eggplant slices under running cold water to wash off all the salt. Pat dry on all sides with paper towels.</li>
            
        <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge eggplant slices in flour on both sides and add to the hot oil, working in batches. Deep fry eggplant until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
