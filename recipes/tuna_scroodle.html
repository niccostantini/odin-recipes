    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Comfort food for depressed people. Yay!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 packages instant noodles</li>

        <li>only one of the seasoning packets from those noodles</li>

        <li>frozen veggies of your choice (California mix, broccoli and cauliflower, stir fry mix, whatever.)</li>

        <li>mayo (or sour cream or yogurt, or butter. Basically noodle lube...)</li>

        <li>optional: any seasonings you feel like adding.</li>

       <li>one can tuna (or other canned meat) 170g-ish</li>


    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water. Add noodles and veggies and cook till desired softness. (Harder veggies can be added, partially cooked, and THEN add the noodles, if you give enough of a flying f**k) while the noodles/veggies are cooking, drain tuna and dump on a dinner plate. Spoon about 2 heaping scoops of mayo on top, dump the dry seasoning packet on. Add any seasonings you feel like (or don't). When the noodles/veggies are finished cooking, drain and dump on top. Mix. Eat. Chill leftovers for a later depression-meal right out of the container/fridge.</li>
